Description: A fork of the cropsim R package by Hijmans et al. This package is
    intended to make the EPIRICE model easier to use outside of IRRI. This version
    removes the "oldweather" package dependency, which makes it easier to use the
    model without access to the IRRI geoclim database. Also removed are other models
    and extra bits that were part of the original cropsim that were not necessary
    for EPIRICE.
