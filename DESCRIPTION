Description: A fork of the 'cropsim' R package by Hijmans et al., this package
    intends to make the 'EPIRICE' model easier to use. The original manuscript
    by Savary et al.Â (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.cropro.2011.11.009> detailed the
    model's development, use and results from modeling global unmanaged
    epidemics of rice diseases for five major rice diseases, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight and tungro. `epirice` provides
    functions to simulate all of these diseases and also provides a generic
    Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed ('SEIR') model that is suitable for
    use in other pathosystems as well provided the proper inputs.
