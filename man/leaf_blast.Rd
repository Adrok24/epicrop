\title{Predict leaf blast area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC)}
\usage{
leaf_blast(wth, emergence = "2000-05-15", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{wth}{- Weather data source}

\item{emergence}{- Expected date of crop emergence}

\item{...}{Additional arguments - See \link[epiRice]{SEIR}}
}
\value{
A raster of AUDPC values for leaf blast based on given weather data
}
\description{
A dynamic mechanistic simulation of leaf blast disease of rice.
The model is driven by daily weather data. Adapted from cropsim package
version 0.2.0-5 by Adam H. Sparks - USQ CCH.
Original model development: Serge Savary & Rene Pangga (IRRI).
Original R implementation by Robert J. Hijmans, Rene Pangga, & Jorrel Aunario
(IRRI).
