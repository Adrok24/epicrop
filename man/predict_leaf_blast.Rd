\title{Predict leaf blast area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC)}
\usage{
predict_leaf_blast(wth, emergence = "2000-05-15", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{wth}{Weather data with a daily time-step, normally NASA-POWER, but any
data that has the following fields will work:
\describe{
  \item{YEAR}{Year in YYYY format}
  \item{DOY}{Numeric day of year, e.g. 1 - 365}
  \item{T2M}{Mean daily temperature}
  \item{T2MN}{Minimum daily temperature}
  \item{T2MX}{Maximum daily temperature}
  \item{RH2M}{Relative humidity}
  \item{RAIN}{Precipitation}
}}

\item{emergence}{Expected date of crop emergence}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, see \code{\link{SEIR}}}
}
\value{
A raster of AUDPC values for leaf blast based on given weather data
}
\description{
A dynamic mechanistic simulation of leaf blast disease of rice.
The model is driven by daily weather data. Adapted from cropsim package
version 0.2.0-5 by Adam H. Sparks - USQ CCH.
Original model development: Serge Savary & Rene Pangga (IRRI).
Original R implementation by Robert J. Hijmans, Rene Pangga, & Jorrel Aunario
(IRRI).
