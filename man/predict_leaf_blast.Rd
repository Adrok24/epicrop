\title{Predict rice leaf blast area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC)}
\usage{
predict_leaf_blast(wth, emergence = "2000-05-15", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{wth}{Weather data with a daily time-step, normally NASA-POWER from
\code{\link{get_wth}}, but any data that has the properly named fields data
in them will work.
\itemize{
\item YYYYMMDD Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
\item DOY Numeric day of year, e.g. 1 - 365
\item T2M Mean daily temperature
\item T2MN Minimum daily temperature
\item T2MX Maximum daily temperature
\item RH2M Relative humidity
\item RAIN Precipitation
}}

\item{emergence}{Expected date of crop emergence}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, see \code{\link{SEIR}}}
}
\value{
An \pkg{epirice} \code{SEIR} object
}
\description{
A dynamic mechanistic simulation of leaf blast disease of rice, causal agent
\emph{Magnaporthe oryzae}.
The model is driven by daily weather data. Adapted from \pkg{cropsim} package
version 0.2.0-5 by Adam H. Sparks - USQ CCH.
Original model development: Serge Savary & Rene Pangga (IRRI).
Original \R implementation by Robert J. Hijmans, Rene Pangga, & Jorrel
Aunario (IRRI).
